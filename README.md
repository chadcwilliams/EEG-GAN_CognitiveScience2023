## Evaluation of the EEG-GAN Package

The [EEG-GAN](https://autoresearch.github.io/EEG-GAN/) package was developed in conjunction with this manuscript; however, this repository is the evaluation of this package, rather than the package itself. As can be seen within the manuscript, we evaluated whether EEG-GAN can produce realistic EEG data and augment this EEG data to improve classification performance. The data used in this manuscript was drawn from [Williams et al.'s, 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psyp.13722) [open-source](https://osf.io/65x4v/) study.
